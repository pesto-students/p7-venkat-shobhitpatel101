# Exercise 1.1
### a. What is the main functionality of the browser?
> Web browsers are used to interact with websites on the internet, as well as other content created with programming languages such as Hypertext Markup Language and Extensible Markup Language. Browsers convert Hypertext Transfer Protocol web pages and websites into human-readable content. They can also show other protocols and prefixes, such as secure HTTP, File Transfer Protocol, email handling, and files.


### b. High Level Components of a browser.
> 1. It has user interface.
> 2. It has rendering engine to render web content.
> 3. Networking
> 4. Data Storage
> 5. Javascript interpreter

### c. Rendering engine and its use.
> Responsible for displaying requested content. For example if the requested content is HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.

### d. Parsers (HTML, CSS, etc)
> Parsers can be used to parse the HTML, CSS content present in the internet and will be displayed to user when required.

### e. Script Processors
> Script Processors will process the javascript content present in internet/ webpages and display to users.

### f. Tree construction
> The CSSOM and DOM trees are combined into a render tree, which is then used to compute the layout of each visible element and serves as an input to the paint process that renders the pixels to screen. Optimizing each of these steps is critical to achieving optimal rendering performance.

### g. Order of script processing
> The order in which commands to download external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files and JavaScript files are placed in an HTML page can affect how quickly the page is rendered and even whether the page is rendered at all.

### h. Layout and Painting
